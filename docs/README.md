# SozuPay Dashboard — Documentation

This repo is the **NGO Dashboard (SozuPay)** for the Sozu stack: beneficiary management, disbursement schedules, batch USDC payouts, repayment tracking, and reporting. The first deployment is **Year 1 NGO microcredit** in Argentina (partner: MUJERES 2000) on Stellar + Soroban + USDC.

Docs are grouped by purpose. Read in the order below for a clear picture; use the folder list to jump to a topic.

## How it fits together

- **Strategy and product:** Sozu is financial infrastructure (self-custody, transparency, programmable money). Year 1 = NGO disbursement + Sozu Wallet + offramp; Year 2+ = merchant settlement; Year 4 = own the rail. This dashboard is the NGO control plane: staff manage beneficiaries, approve disbursements, confirm repayments, and run reports.
- **Technical flow:** Staff log in (Privy), pick an organization, and use the dashboard. The org has a wallet (classic G or Soroban contract C) that holds USDC; payouts go to recipient Stellar addresses. Persistence and batch execution are in progress; runbooks describe local dev and env.
- **Current work:** 30-day sprint (landing, SDP provider registration, dashboard MVP with single on-chain payout). Full Year 1 scope is in the NGO dev plan and production-disbursements tasks; todo.md is the task checklist.
