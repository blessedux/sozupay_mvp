# Login flow

## Overview

1. **Visit /login** – Session and Privy state are cleared so the user must authenticate and choose email every time (no “already logged in” redirect to dashboard).
2. **Log in** – User clicks “Log in”; Privy modal (email / passkey) runs. User chooses which email to use.
3. **Session sync** – When Privy reports `authenticated`, the app calls `POST /api/auth/privy` with `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and `{ email }`. Backend verifies the token, creates or loads the user in DB, sets the `sozupay_session` cookie, returns `{ ok: true }`.
4. **Organization picker** – Client redirects to `/onboarding/organizations`. User sees:
   - **Organizations they can access** – “Continue to dashboard” sets the current org in session and goes to dashboard.
   - **Create new organization** – Shown if super_admin with no org (or always for super_admin); links to `/onboarding/create-organization`. After creating, they return to the org picker and select the new org.
   - **No access** – If they have no orgs and cannot create, they see “Contact your administrator” and Log out.
5. **Dashboard** – After selecting an org (or creating one and selecting it), session includes `orgId` and the user is on the dashboard. Balance, tx history, and DeFi are for the **organization wallet**.
6. **Logout** – `POST /api/auth/logout` clears session and redirects to `/login`.

## APIs

- **GET /api/auth/clear-session** – Clears the session cookie (no redirect). Called by the login page on load.
- **POST /api/auth/set-org** – Body `{ orgId }`. Sets `session.orgId` so dashboard uses that organization. User must have access (currently: `user.org_id === orgId`; later: org membership).
- **GET /api/profile/organizations** – Returns `{ organizations: [{ id, name }], canCreate }` for the current user. Used by the org picker.

## Middleware

- **With Privy:** No session → redirect `/dashboard`, `/onboarding/*`, `/auth/success` to `/login`. **No redirect from /login to /dashboard** when session exists, so the user always sees the login page and can choose email.
- **Mock auth (no Privy, dev):** Session on `/login` → redirect to `/dashboard`.

## Session

- Session may include `orgId` (current organization to manage). Set when the user selects an org on the org picker, or auto-set in profile when the user has a single `org_id` and session has no `orgId` yet.
- Dashboard and wallet resolution use `session.orgId ?? user.org_id` for the current org.

## Env

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` – required for login UI.
- `PRIVY_APP_ID` / `PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY` – required for `/api/auth/privy` token verification.
- `AUTH_SECRET` – used to sign the session cookie (use a strong value in production).
